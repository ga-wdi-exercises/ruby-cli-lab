# NOTE: what follows here is the most recent attempt at categorizing the cards, and then
#pushing them into the categories array.
#the idea is this:
  #go through DECK.  find each card in DECK by category and then assign to array
  #either geo, fud, or rndm.
  #THEN push each one of those arrays up into the categories array.
  #full disclosure: i don't know if this works.

  fud = [$deck.find{|x| x['category'] == 'food'}]
  $categories << fud

  rndm = [$deck.find{|x| x['category'] == 'random'}]
  $categories << rndm
end


# NOTE: this was my first attempt at beginning categorization.
#I abandoned it when I found the above method on stack overflow.
#but i decided not to delete it just yet, in case it ends up being useful.

#   geo = (card.category == "geography")
