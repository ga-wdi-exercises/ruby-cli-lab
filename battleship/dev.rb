# Pseudocode
# build the board
# vertical and horizontal axis
# use numbers for vertical and alphabet for horizontal
# I can use enumberables to create a board like I did card deck
# but I will manually create the board

# create the board
# create the battleships
# create the player and what the player can do

require 'pry'
# using symbols cuz they faster
board = {
    :a => 1, 
    :b => 2, 
    :c => 3,
    :d => 4,
    :e => 5,
    :f => 6,
    :g => 7,
    :h => 8,
    :i => 9,
    :j => 10
